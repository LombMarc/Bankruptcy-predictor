## Summary and info
After proper trasnformation of the dataset, we have built three possible ML model to predict the default of a firm. 
First we have explored the dataset analysing the kind of datatype and the correlation among the features. 
To address the class imbalance we introduced the SMOTE method. We have done some preliminary feature selection through the mean of correlation and then a proper PCA built inside the pipeline itself. 
Finally, we have built three different ML model focusing at the end on the SVM method which shows best accuracy performance.
